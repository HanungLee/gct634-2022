# Instruction to set up the course Conda virtual environment 


We will use Python throughout the course. For practice session and homework, we will manage all library packages under a Conda virtual environment named "gct634". As a first step, please install the Python 3 version of Anaconda (https://repo.anaconda.com/). It will provide a cross-platform installation package. 

*** Windows Users: please use Linux running on Windows such as Ubuntu on Windows (https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/ubuntu-on-windows#1-overview) and then run Python on it ***

After you have installed conda, close any open terminals you might have. Then open a new terminal and run the following command:


1. Create a gct634 environment with python 3.10 and install essential packages

   conda create -n gct634 python=3.10 jupyter jupyterlab matplotlib <br>

2. Activate the new environment:

    conda activate gct634

3. Install IPython kernel so we can use this environment in jupyter notebook: 

    python -m ipykernel install --user --name gct634

4. install librosa

    conda install -y -c conda-forge librosa

5. Run Jupyter Notebook 

   jupyter notebook 	

6. Go to the "basics" folder and open a Jupyter notebook file (*.ipynb). 
 
7. To deactivate the active environment, use
    
   conda deactivate
